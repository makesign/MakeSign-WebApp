## MakeSign



MakeSign is a free and open-source digital signage solution developed by students at HTW-Berlin. It leverages old monitors in conjunction with microcomputers like Raspberry Pi to create an efficient digital signage infrastructure.

## How It Works

MakeSign is a dynamic digital signage solution designed to manage and display content efficiently across multiple screens. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **Slides**: Upload and manage individual slides. Each slide can be customized with various media elements.
- **Slideshows**: Create and organize slideshows by adding multiple slides. Slideshows serve as collections of slides that can be displayed sequentially.
- **Screens**: Manage your screens and configure how they display content. For each monitor, you can set up a unique screen and assign a specific display link.
- **Display Management**: Within the Screens tab, select which slideshows should be displayed on each screen. You can customize the content shown on each monitor, ensuring that the right slideshows appear on the intended screens.

This setup allows for flexible and targeted digital signage solutions, making it easy to control what content is shown where and when.
